title: Improve Tor Relay IPv6 Support
---
subtitle:

Tor helps people stay safe on the internet, by keeping their internet use secure and anonymous. More Tor clients are running on IPv6-only or dual-stack networks. But only 20% of Torâ€™s available relay bandwidth supports IPv6. We want to automate relay IPv6 address discovery and reachability checks, so that it is easier for relay operators to run IPv6 relays.

body:

Students may choose to focus on designing and implementing core features, tor relay testing, reporting statistics, or diagnosing and fixing bugs.
