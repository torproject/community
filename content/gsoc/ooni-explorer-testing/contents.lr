# Background

OONI Explorer is an open data resource on internet censorship around the world. This project is about making improvements to the end to end tests of OONI Explorer.

# Proposal

Currently, we only have a very basic set of end-to-end tests inside of OONI Explorer, which have been developed using the Cypress end-to-end testing tool. See: https://github.com/ooni/explorer/tree/master/cypress

As part of this project, the student will work together with the OONI team to define a list of actions and operations that we would like to automate and test. Based on this, they will write end-to-end integration tests using Cypress.

Currently, OONI Explorer does not have any unit tests. The student is therefore encouraged to explore and look into adding unit testing to the Explorer components.

Moreover, the student is encouraged to research other ways to improve the quality and testing coverage of the OONI Explorer application, such as visual testing tools like percy: https://percy.io/
