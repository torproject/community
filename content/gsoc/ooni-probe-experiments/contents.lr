subtitle:

OONI Probe is a free software project that aims to uncover internet censorship around the world. As part of this project you would be working on researching and developing new OONI Probe network experiments.

# Background

The Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) is a free software project which aims to empower decentralized efforts in increasing transparency of internet censorship around the world.

We develop free and open source software, called OONI Probe, that users can run to measure:

- Blocking of websites;
- Blocking of instant messaging apps (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Telegram);
- Blocking of censorship circumvention tools (such as Tor);
- Presence of systems (middleboxes) in your network that might be responsible for censorship and/or surveillance;
- Speed and performance of your network.

By running OONI Probe, users can collect data that can potentially serve as evidence of internet censorship since it shows how, when, where, and by whom it is implemented.

# Proposal

*Prerequisites:* Knowledge of network programming

As part of this project you would be working on researching and developing new OONI Probe network experiments. These experiments would be integrated inside of probe-engine and could eventually make their way into the OONI Probe desktop client.

The GSoC project is only about researching and implementing a working test in probe-engine, not the UI and client integration of the test.
