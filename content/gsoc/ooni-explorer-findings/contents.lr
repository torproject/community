# Background

OONI Explorer is an open data resource on internet censorship around the world.
OONI Probe is the software used to collect network measurements which are then
shown on OONI Explorer.  This project is about making improvements to how
findings from OONI Probe tests are displayed on OONI Explorer when shared on
social media.

# Proposal

Currently, when an OONI Probe user wants to share their network measurement findings from their mobile app, the only option they have is to take screenshots and to share them on social media.

As part of this activity, the student is asked to improve how OONI measurements are displayed when they are shared on social media.

This includes:
* Setting the appropriate meta tags to measurement page headers: https://github.com/ooni/explorer/issues/202
* Generating a screenshot preview to display on the various social media platforms
* Validating that the measurements are displayed well
* Improving the indexing of OONI Explorer by search engines: https://github.com/ooni/ooni.org/issues/328
* Adding some Call to Action functionality to encourage users to install OONI Probe

Moreover, the student is encouraged to explore other ways through which OONI
Probe users may be interested in sharing findings (such as a measurement result
set) and how these can be presented in OONI Explorer and embedded in social
media.

Other relevant github issues include:

Add support for native sharing capability in OONI Probe

Easier exploration of reports by a specific probe
