# Background

OONI Probe Desktop is the next generation electron desktop client for running
OONI tests on windows, macOS and Linux. This project is about adding
capabilities related to custom URL testing.

# Proposal

Currently the OONI Probe Desktop app does not support specifying a custom URL
for testing.

As part of this project, the student will add UI support for specifying a
custom URL inside of the OONI Probe desktop app. See:
https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/936

The student will also look into adding support for the handling of OONI Run
links on desktop as well. This will involve creating a deep link handler on
desktop to trigger OONI Run links in OONI Probe desktop too. See:
https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues/1071

The OONI Probe Desktop app is an electron based desktop app, and the source
code is available here: https://github.com/ooni/probe-desktop

Issues for OONI Probe Desktop are tracked here:
https://github.com/ooni/probe/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aooni%2Fprobe-desktop

Under the hood, the OONI Probe desktop app is controlling a golang-based
command line interface, called probe-cli: https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli
