title: The Tor network
----
description:
- An open network, everyone can be part of it. Basically, your server will relay the tor traffic to another server in the Internet.
- The network is composed by different types of servers run by volunteers around the world.
- To ingress in the network, the new server will pass automatically to a new relay lifecycle.

title: Why run a Tor relay?
----
description:
By running a Tor relay you can help make the Tor network:
- faster (and therefore more usable
- more robust against attacks
- more stable in case of outages
- safer for its users (spying on more relays is harder than on a few)
