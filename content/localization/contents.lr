##Localization is how we reach a global community.

In order for Tor to work for everyone, it needs to speak everyone's languages.
Our volunteer translation team works hard to make this a reality, and we can always use more help.
Our current translation priorities are translating the [Tor Browser](https://torpat.ch/locales), its documentation and the [Tor Project website](https://torpat.ch/tpo-locales), and there are always other documents to translate.
