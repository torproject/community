# Localization mailing list
<a name="tor-l10n" />

To communicate with other translators, please join the [Tor localization mailing list](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-l10n), where we organize translations, take decisions, report errors in source strings, etc. Please introduce yourself and ask any questions you may have after following up these instructions.

# Translation platform
