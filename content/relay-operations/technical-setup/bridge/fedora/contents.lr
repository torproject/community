### 1. Install Tor and dependencies

Add the following to `/etc/yum.repos.d/tor.repo`

```
[tor]
name=Tor for Fedora $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://rpm.torproject.org/fedora/$releasever/$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://rpm.torproject.org/fedora/public_gpg.key
cost=100
```
Then install Tor and the dependencies.


`# dnf install git golang tor policycoreutils-python-utils`


### 2. Build obfs4proxy and move it into place.


`export GOPATH='mktemp -d'`

`go get gitlab.com/yawning/obfs4.git/obfs4proxy`

`sudo cp $GOPATH/bin/obfs4proxy /usr/local/bin/`

And tell selinux to allow Tor to use obfs4proxy:

`sudo /sbin/restorecon -v /usr/local/bin/obfs4proxy`


### 3. Edit your Tor config file, usually located at `/etc/tor/torrc` and replace its content with:

```
RunAsDaemon 1
BridgeRelay 1

# Replace "TODO1" with a Tor port of your choice.  This port must be externally
# reachable.  Avoid port 9001 because it's commonly associated with Tor and
# censors may be scanning the Internet for this port.
ORPort TODO1

ServerTransportPlugin obfs4 exec /usr/local/bin/obfs4proxy

# Replace "TODO2" with an obfs4 port of your choice.  This port must be
# externally reachable and must be different from the one specified for ORPort.
# Avoid port 9001 because it's commonly associated with
# Tor and censors may be scanning the Internet for this port.
ServerTransportListenAddr obfs4 0.0.0.0:TODO2

# Local communication port between Tor and obfs4.  Always set this to "auto".
# "Ext" means "extended", not "external".  Don't try to set a specific port
# number, nor listen on 0.0.0.0.
ExtORPort auto

# Replace "<address@email.com>" with your email address so we can contact you if
# there are problems with your bridge.  This is optional but encouraged.
ContactInfo <address@email.com>

# Pick a nickname that you like for your bridge.  This is optional.
Nickname PickANickname
```

 Don't forget to change the `ORPort`, `ServerTransportListenAddr`, `ContactInfo`, and `Nickname` options.

* Note that both Tor's OR port and its obfs4 port must be reachable. If your bridge is behind a firewall or NAT, make sure to open both ports. You can use [our reachability test](https://bridges.torproject.org/scan/) to see if your obfs4 port is reachable from the Internet.

### 4. Restart Tor

`sudo semanage port -a -t tor_port_t -p tcp [OR port set earlier, in TODO1]`

`sudo semanage port -a -t tor_port_t -p tcp [obfs4 port set earlier, in TODO2]`

`sudo systemctl restart tor`


### 5. Monitor your logs (usually in your syslog)

To confirm your bridge is running with no issues, you should see something like this:

```
[notice] Your Tor server's identity key fingerprint is '<NICKNAME> <FINGERPRINT>'
[notice] Your Tor bridge's hashed identity key fingerprint is '<NICKNAME> <HASHED FINGERPRINT>'
[notice] Registered server transport 'obfs4' at '[::]:46396'
[notice] Tor has successfully opened a circuit. Looks like client functionality is working.
[notice] Bootstrapped 100%: Done
[notice] Now checking whether ORPort <redacted>:3818 is reachable... (this may take up to 20 minutes -- look for log messages indicating success)
[notice] Self-testing indicates your ORPort is reachable from the outside. Excellent. Publishing server descriptor.
```

### 6. Final notes

If you are having trouble setting up your bridge, have a look at [our help
section](https://community.torproject.org/relay/getting-help/). If
your bridge is now running, check out the [post-install
notes](https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/bridge/post-install/).
