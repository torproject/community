### 1. Install packages


`# pkg install obfs4proxy-tor tor ca_root_nss`


### 2. Edit your Tor config file, usually located at `/usr/local/etc/tor` and replace its content with:

```
RunAsDaemon 1
BridgeRelay 1

# Replace "TODO1" with a Tor port of your choice.  This port must be externally
# reachable.  Avoid port 9001 because it's commonly associated with Tor and
# censors may be scanning the Internet for this port.
ORPort TODO1

ServerTransportPlugin obfs4 exec /usr/local/bin/obfs4proxy

# Replace "TODO2" with an obfs4 port of your choice.  This port must be
# externally reachable and must be different from the one specified for ORPort.
# Avoid port 9001 because it's commonly associated with
# Tor and censors may be scanning the Internet for this port.
ServerTransportListenAddr obfs4 0.0.0.0:TODO2

# Local communication port between Tor and obfs4.  Always set this to "auto".
# "Ext" means "extended", not "external".  Don't try to set a specific port
# number, nor listen on 0.0.0.0.
ExtORPort auto

# Replace "<address@email.com>" with your email address so we can contact you if
# there are problems with your bridge.  This is optional but encouraged.
ContactInfo <address@email.com>

# Pick a nickname that you like for your bridge.  This is optional.
Nickname PickANickname

Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
```

Don't forget to change the `ORPort`, `ServerTransportListenAddr`, `ContactInfo`, and `Nickname` options.

* Note that both Tor's OR port and its obfs4 port must be reachable. If your bridge is behind a firewall or NAT, make sure to open both ports. You can use [our reachability test](https://bridges.torproject.org/scan/) to see if your obfs4 port is reachable from the Internet.

* Are you using FreeBSD's firewall with a "default deny" policy? If so, make sure that your obfs4proxy can talk to your Tor process over the loopback interface.  Don't forget to allow Tor's `ExtORPort`.

### 3. Ensure that the `random_id` sysctl setting is enabled:

`# echo "net.inet.ip.random_id=1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf`

`# sysctl net.inet.ip.random_id=1`


### 4. Start the Tor daemon and make sure it starts at boot:


`# sysrc tor_enable=YES`

`# service tor start`


### 5. Monitor your logs

To confirm your bridge is running with no issues, you should see something like this in `/var/log/tor/notices.log`:

```
[notice] Your Tor server's identity key fingerprint is '<NICKNAME> <FINGERPRINT>'
[notice] Your Tor bridge's hashed identity key fingerprint is '<NICKNAME> <HASHED FINGERPRINT>'
[notice] Registered server transport 'obfs4' at '[::]:46396'
[notice] Tor has successfully opened a circuit. Looks like client functionality is working.
[notice] Bootstrapped 100%: Done
[notice] Now checking whether ORPort <redacted>:3818 is reachable... (this may take up to 20 minutes -- look for log messages indicating success)
[notice] Self-testing indicates your ORPort is reachable from the outside. Excellent. Publishing server descriptor.
```


### 6. To get the fastest package updates, switch from the "quarterly" package repo to the "latest" repo.

Create the following folder:


`mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos`


Create the file `/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf` with the following content:

```
FreeBSD: { enabled: no }

FreeBSDlatest: {
  url: "pkg+https://pkg.FreeBSD.org/${ABI}/latest",
  mirror_type: "srv",
  signature_type: "fingerprints",
  fingerprints: "/usr/share/keys/pkg",
  enabled: yes
}
```

### 7. Final notes

If you are having trouble setting up your bridge, have a look at [our help
section](https://community.torproject.org/relay/getting-help/). If
your bridge is now running, check out the [post-install
notes](https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/bridge/post-install/).
