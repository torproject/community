body:

This guide will help you set up an obfs4 bridge to help censored users connect to the Tor network. The requirements are:
1. 24/7 Internet connectivity
2. The ability to expose TCP ports to the Internet (make sure that NAT doesn't get in the way)

Note 1: If you're running a platform that is not listed on this page, you can [compile obfs4 from source](https://gitlab.com/yawning/obfs4#installation).

Note 2: If you're planning to turn an existing but non-bridge relay into a bridge relay, changing IP address, name and fingerprint is advised to avoid easy discovery and blocklisting by ISP or governments.
