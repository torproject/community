# 1. Enable Automatic Software Updates

One of the most important things to keeps your relay secure is to install security updates timely and ideally automatically so you can not forget about it. Follow the instructions to enable [automatic software updates](updates) for your operating system.

# 2. Enable the EPEL repository

To install `tor` package on CentOS/RHEL, you need to install the [EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) repository first:

`yum install epel-release`

# 3. Add the following to /etc/yum.repos.d/tor.repo and then install the tor package.

```
[tor]
name=Tor for Enterprise Linux $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://rpm.torproject.org/centos/$releasever/$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://rpm.torproject.org/centos/public_gpg.key
cost=100
```

`yum install tor`

When you install the first package from the EPEL repository you will be asked about verifying the EPEL GPG signing key.
Please ensure the key matches with the one available on the [Fedora Project website](https://getfedora.org/keys/).

# 4. Put the tor configuration file `/etc/tor/torrc` in place

```
#change the nickname "myNiceRelay" to a name that you like
Nickname myNiceRelay
ORPort 9001
SocksPort 0
ExitRelay 0
# Change the email address below and be aware that it will be published
ContactInfo tor-operator@your-emailaddress-domain
```

# 5. Enable and start your Tor relay

CentOS 7 / RHEL 7:

```
systemctl enable tor
systemctl start tor
```

CentOS 6 / RHEL 6:

```
service tor enable
service tor start
```

# 6. Final notes

If you are having trouble setting up your relay, have a look at our [help section](/relay/getting-help/).
If your relay is now running, check out the [post-install](/relay/setup/post-install/) notes.
