# 1. Install `tor` OpenBSD's Package

Recent OpenBSD systems, like 6.5/amd64, already have the repository configured on `/etc/installurl` so we do not need to bother changing it.

If that's not your case, please adjust the `installurl` configuration file like this:

```
echo "https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD" > /etc/installurl
```

Proceed with `pkg_add` to install the package:

```
pkg_add tor
```

### 2.1. Recommended Steps to Install `tor` on OpenBSD

If you want to install a newer version of the `tor` OpenBSD's package, you can use M:Tier's binary packages:

```
ftp https://stable.mtier.org/openup
```

Right after fetching `openup` you can run it to sync M:Tier's repository and update your packages; it's an alternative to `pkg_add -u`.

Here is how you proceed with these steps:

```
openup
```

# 3. Configure `/etc/tor/torrc`

This is a very simple version of the `torrc` configuration file in order to run a Middle/Guard relay on the Tor network:

```
Nickname    myBSDRelay    # Change your relay's nickname to something you like
ContactInfo your@email    # Please write your email address and be aware that it will be published
ORPort      443           # You might want to use/try a different port, should you want to
ExitRelay   0
SocksPort   0
Log notice  syslog
User        _tor
```

# 4. Change `openfiles-max` and `maxfiles` Tweaks

By default, OpenBSD maintains a rather low limit on the maximum number of open files for a process. For a daemon such as Tor's, that opens a connection to each and every other relay (currently around 7000 relays), these limits should be raised.

Append the following section to `/etc/login.conf`:

```
tor:
    :openfiles-max=13500:
    :tc=daemon:
```

OpenBSD also stores a kernel-level file descriptor limit in the sysctl variable `kern.maxfiles`.

Increase it from the default of 7030 to 16000:

```
echo "kern.maxfiles=16000" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl kern.maxfiles=16000
```

# 6. Start `tor`:

Here we set `tor` to start during boot and call it for the first time:

```
rcctl enable tor
rcctl start tor
```
