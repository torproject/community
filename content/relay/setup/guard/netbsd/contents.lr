# 1. Enable Automatic Software Updates

One of the most important things to keeps your relay secure is to install security updates timely and ideally automatically so you can not forget about it. Follow the instructions to enable automatic software updates for your operating system.

# 1. Setup `pkg_add`

```
echo "PKG_PATH=http://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/$(uname -m)/$(uname -r)/All" > /etc/pkg_install.conf
```

# 2. Install `tor` NetBSD's package

```
pkg_add tor
```

# 3. Configure `/usr/pkg/etc/tor/torrc`

```
Nickname    myBSDRelay    # Change your relay's nickname to something you like
ContactInfo your@email    # Please write your email address and be aware that it will be published
ORPort      443           # You might want to use/try a different port, should you want to
ExitRelay   0
SocksPort   0
Log notice  syslog
```

# 6. Start `tor`:

Here we set `tor` to start during boot and call it for the first time:

```
ln -sf /usr/pkg/share/examples/rc.d/tor /etc/rc.d/tor
echo "tor=YES" >> /etc/rc.conf
/etc/rc.d/tor start
```
