# 1. Enable Automatic Software Updates

One of the most important things to keeps your relay secure is to install security updates timely and ideally automatically so you can not forget about it. Follow the instructions to enable automatic software updates for your operating system.

# 2. Setup `pkg_add`

Modern versions of the NetBSD operating system can be set to use `pkgin`, which is a piece of software aimed to be like `apt` or `yum` for managing pkgsrc binary packages. We are not convering its setup here, and opt to use plain `pkg_add` instead.

```
# echo "PKG_PATH=http://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/$(uname -m)/$(uname -r)/All" > /etc/pkg_install.conf
```

# 3. Install `tor` NetBSD's Package

```
# pkg_add tor
```

# 4. Configure `/usr/pkg/etc/tor/torrc`

This is a very simple version of the `torrc` configuration file in order to run a Middle/Guard relay on the Tor network:

```
Nickname    myNiceRelay  # Change "myNiceRelay" to something you like
ContactInfo your@e-mail  # Write your e-mail and be aware it will be published
ORPort      443          # You might use a different port, should you want to
ExitRelay   0
SocksPort   0
Log notice  syslog
```

# 5. Start `tor`

Here we set `tor` to start during boot and call it for the first time:

```
# ln -sf /usr/pkg/share/examples/rc.d/tor /etc/rc.d/tor
# echo "tor=YES" >> /etc/rc.conf
# /etc/rc.d/tor start
```

# 6. Final Notes

If you are having trouble setting up your relay, have a look at our [help section](/relay/getting-help/).
If your relay is now running, check out the [post-install](/relay/setup/post-install/) notes.
