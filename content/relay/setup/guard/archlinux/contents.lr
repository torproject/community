### 1. Enable Automatic Software Updates

One of the most important things to keep your relay secure is to install security updates timely and ideally automatically so you can not forget about it.
Follow the instructions to enable automatic software updates for your operating system.

### 2. Install `tor`

To install the `tor` package on Arch Linux, please run:

```
# pacman -Syu tor
```

### 3. Configure `/etc/tor/torrc`

Put the configuration file `/etc/tor/torrc` in place

```
Nickname      myNiceRelay  # Change "myNiceRelay" to something you like
ContactInfo   your@e-mail  # Write your e-mail and be aware it will be published
ORPort        443          # You might use a different port, should you want to
ExitRelay     0
SocksPort     0
Log notice    syslog
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor
User          tor
```

### 4. Enable and Start `tor`

```
# systemctl enable --now tor
```
    ... or restart it if it was running already, so configurations take effect

```
# systemctl restart tor
```

### 5. Final Notes

If you are having trouble setting up your bridge, have a look at [our help section](../../../getting-help/).
If your bridge is now running, check out the [post-install notes](../../post-install/).
