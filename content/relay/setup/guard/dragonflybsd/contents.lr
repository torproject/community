# 1. Enable Automatic Software Updates

One of the most important things to keeps your relay secure is to install security updates timely and ideally automatically so you can not forget about it. Follow the instructions to enable automatic software updates for your operating system.

# 2. Bootstrap `pkg`

DragonFlyBSD's daily snapshots and releases (starting with 3.4) come with `pkg` already installed. Upgrades from earlier releases, however, will not have it. If `pkg` is missing on the system for any reason, it can be quickly bootstrapped without having to build it from source or even having **DPorts** installed:

```
# cd /usr
# make pkg-bootstrap
# rehash
# pkg-static install -y pkg
# rehash
```

### 2.1. Recommended Steps to Setup `pkg`

Here, it will be similar to what we have on a **FreeBSD** system, and we are going to use HTTPS to fetch our packages, and updates - so here we also need an extra package to help us out (ca_root_nss).

Installing the `ca_root_nss` package:

```
# pkg install ca_root_nss
```

For fresh installations, the file `/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/df-latest.conf.sample` is copied to `/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/df-latest`. The files ending in the ".sample" extension are ignored; pkg(8) only reads files that end in ".conf" and it will read as many as it finds.

DragonflyBSD has 2 packages repositories:

  - Avalon (mirror-master.dragonflybsd.org);
  - Wolfpond (pkg.wolfpond.org).

We can simply edit the **URL** used to point out the repositories on `/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/df-latest` and that's it! Remember to use **pkg+https://** for Avalon.

After applying all these changes, we update the packages list again and try to check if there's already a new update to apply:

```
# pkg update -f
# pkg upgrade -y -f
```

# 3. Install `tor` DragonFlyBSD's Package

Install the `tor` package:

```
# pkg install tor
```

  ... or install an alpha release:


```
# pkg install tor-devel
```

# 4. Configure `/usr/local/etc/tor/torrc`

This is a very simple version of the `torrc` configuration file in order to run a Middle/Guard relay on the Tor network:

```
Nickname    myNiceRelay  # Change "myNiceRelay" to something you like
ContactInfo your@e-mail  # Write your e-mail and be aware it will be published
ORPort      443          # You might use a different port, should you want to
ExitRelay   0
SocksPort   0
Log notice  syslog
```

# 5. Start `tor`

Here we set `tor` to start at boot time and use the setuid feature, in order to bind to lower ports like 443 (the daemon itself will still run as a regular non-privileged user).

```
# echo "tor_setuid=YES" >> /etc/rc.conf
# echo "tor_enable=YES" >> /etc/rc.conf
# service tor start
```

# 6. Final Notes

If you are having trouble setting up your relay, have a look at our [help section](/relay/getting-help/).
If your relay is now running, check out the [post-install](/relay/setup/post-install/) notes.
