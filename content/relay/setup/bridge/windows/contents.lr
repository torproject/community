**Note: You should only run a Windows bridge if you can run it 24/7. If the operator is unable to guarantee that, a [Snowflake](https://snowflake.torproject.org/) is a better way to contribute resources.**

### 1. Download the Windows Expert Bundle and the Tor Browser

* [Windows Expert Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/download/tor/). Unzip the contents on the desktop.

* [Tor Browser (version depends on your computer)](https://www.torproject.org/download/languages/). Run the `.exe` and install with default settings.

You will need to show hidden items and file name extensions. In your Explorer window, in the top-left, click on the View tab. In the Show/hide section furthest to the right, check the checkbox for Hidden items; check the checkbox for File name extensions.

### 2. Build files and relocate 

Open up the Tor folder on your desktop. Double click `tor.exe`. Once the command prompt reads: `[notice] Bootstrapped 100% (done): Done`, close the window. This creates the folder `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\tor\` (where `<user>` is your user name).

From the Tor folder on your desktop, select all `.dll`'s and `.exe`'s and cut/paste them into the `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\tor\` folder.

Open up the Data folder on your desktop. Inside that Tor folder, select both `geoip` and `geoip6` and cut/paste them into the `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\tor\` folder.

Navigate to `C:\Users\<user>\Desktop\Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Tor\PluggableTransports`. Select `obfs4proxy.exe` and cut/paste it into the `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\tor\` folder.

### 3. Create and edit your Tor config file

In the `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\tor\` folder, right-click on white space and select `New > Text Document`. Name the file `torrc`; there is no extension.

Double-click on the `torrc` file. When prompted *How do you want to open this file?*, select `Notepad`. Add the following:

```
Log notice file C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\tor\notice.log
GeoIPFile C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\tor\geoip
GeoIPv6File C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\tor\geoip6

BridgeRelay 1

# Replace "TODO1" with a Tor port of your choice.
# This port must be externally reachable.
# Avoid port 9001 because it's commonly associated with Tor and censors may be scanning the Internet for this port.
ORPort TODO1

ServerTransportPlugin obfs4 exec C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\tor\obfs4proxy.exe

# Replace "TODO2" with an obfs4 port of your choice.
# This port must be externally reachable and must be different from the one specified for ORPort.
# Avoid port 9001 because it's commonly associated with Tor and censors may be scanning the Internet for this port.
ServerTransportListenAddr obfs4 0.0.0.0:TODO2

# Local communication port between Tor and obfs4.  Always set this to "auto".
# "Ext" means "extended", not "external".  Don't try to set a specific port number, nor listen on 0.0.0.0.
ExtORPort auto

# Replace "<address@email.com>" with your email address so we can contact you if there are problems with your bridge.
# This is optional but encouraged.
ContactInfo <address@email.com>

# Pick a nickname that you like for your bridge.  This is optional.
Nickname PickANickname
```

Don't forget to change the `ORPort`, `ServerTransportListenAddr`, `ContactInfo`, `<user>`, and `Nickname` options.

* Use a fixed obfs4 port larger than 1024, still avoiding 9001.

* Note that both Tor's OR port and its obfs4 port must be reachable.
  If your bridge is behind a firewall or NAT, make sure to open both ports.
  You can use [our reachability test](https://bridges.torproject.org/scan/) to see if your obfs4 port is reachable from the Internet.

### 4. Start Tor

Open up the Command Prompt App. Change your directory with: `cd C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\tor\`. Type: `tor.exe -f torrc`.

### 5. Monitor your logs

To confirm your bridge is running with no issues, you should see something like this in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\tor\notice.log`.

```
[notice] Your Tor server's identity key fingerprint is '<NICKNAME> <FINGERPRINT>'
[notice] Your Tor bridge's hashed identity key fingerprint is '<NICKNAME> <HASHED FINGERPRINT>'
[notice] Registered server transport 'obfs4' at '[::]:46396'
[notice] Tor has successfully opened a circuit. Looks like client functionality is working.
[notice] Bootstrapped 100%: Done
[notice] Now checking whether ORPort <redacted>:3818 is reachable... (this may take up to 20 minutes -- look for log messages indicating success)
[notice] Self-testing indicates your ORPort is reachable from the outside. Excellent. Publishing server descriptor.
```

### 6. Final notes

If you are having troubles setting up your bridge, have a look at [our help section](https://community.torproject.org/relay/getting-help/). If your bridge is now running, check out the [post-install notes](https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/bridge/post-install/).
