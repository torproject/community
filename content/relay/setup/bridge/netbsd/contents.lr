### 1. Enable Automatic Software Updates

One of the most important things to keeps your relay secure is to install security updates timely and ideally automatically so you can not forget about it. Follow the instructions to enable automatic software updates for your operating system.

### 2. Setup `pkg_add`

Modern versions of the NetBSD operating system can be set to use `pkgin`, which is a piece of software aimed to be like `apt` or `yum` for managing pkgsrc binary packages. We are not convering its setup here, and opt to use plain `pkg_add` instead.

```
# echo "PKG_PATH=http://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/$(uname -m)/$(uname -r)/All" > /etc/pkg_install.conf
```

### 3. Install `tor` NetBSD's Package

```
# pkg_add tor
```

### 4. Install a Pluggable Transport

We are opting here to install and use **obfs4** as pluggable transport, so we are going to install the `obfs4proxy` package:

```
# pkg_add install obfs4proxy
```

### 5. Configure `/usr/pkg/etc/tor/torrc`

This is a very simple version of the `torrc` configuration file in order to run a Bridge on the Tor network:

```
Nickname    myNiceBridge # Change "myNiceBridge" to something you like
ContactInfo your@e-mail  # Write your e-mail and be aware it will be published
ORPort      443          # You might use a different port, should you want to
ExitRelay   0
SocksPort   0
Log notice  syslog
ExtORPort   auto
BridgeRelay 1
ServerTransportPlugin     obfs4 exec /usr/pkg/bin/obfs4proxy
ServerTransportListenAddr obfs4 0.0.0.0:CHANGEME
```

Replace "CHANGEME" with a port of your choice.

This port must be externally reachable and must be different from the one specified for ORPort. Please avoid port 9001 because it's commonly associated with Tor and censors may be scanning the Internet for this port.

  * One pretty important test you should consider doing is to test if we can talk **obfs4** to the port used by **ServerTransportListenAddr**. Please try our [reachability test tool for obfs4 Bridges](https://bridges.torproject.org/scan/) to check that.

### 6. Start `tor`

Here we set `tor` to start during boot and call it for the first time:

```
# ln -sf /usr/pkg/share/examples/rc.d/tor /etc/rc.d/tor
# echo "tor=YES" >> /etc/rc.conf
# /etc/rc.d/tor start
```

### 7. Final Notes

If you are having trouble setting up your bridge, have a look at [our help section](../../../getting-help/).
If your bridge is now running, check out the [post-install notes](../../post-install/).
