### 1. Enable Automatic Software Updates

One of the most important things to keeps your relay secure is to install security updates timely and ideally automatically so you can not forget about it. Follow the instructions to enable automatic software updates for your operating system.

### 2. Install `tor`

```
# zypper install tor
```

### 3. Install a Pluggable Transport

We are opting here to install and use `obfs4` as pluggable transport, so we are going to install `obfs4proxy`.

Sadly there's no package repository we can use to install it on OpenSUSE. We must build it from source.

Here we install the dependencies we need to build the binary:

```
# zypper install go git
```

Now we start building the binary, and copy it to a proper directory used by system's **$PATH**:

```
# mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.ZRyC46eW
# export GOPATH=/tmp/tmp.ZRyC46eW
# go get gitlab.com/yawning/obfs4.git/obfs4proxy
# cp $GOPATH/bin/obfs4proxy /usr/local/bin/.
```

Heavily outdated versions of `git` can make `go get` fail, so try upgrading to a more recent version of `git` if you're running into this problem.

For more information on installing or building `obfs4proxy` from source, please refer to its [official docummentation](https://gitlab.com/yawning/obfs4/-/blob/master/README.md).

### 4. Configure `/etc/tor/torrc`

This is a very simple version of the `torrc` configuration file in order to run a Bridge on the Tor network:

```
Nickname    myNiceBridge # Change "myNiceBridge" to something you like
ContactInfo your@e-mail  # Write your e-mail and be aware it will be published
ORPort      443          # You might use a different port, should you want to
ExitRelay   0
SocksPort   0
BridgeRelay 1
ExtORPort   auto
Log notice  syslog
ServerTransportPlugin     obfs4 exec /usr/local/bin/obfs4proxy
ServerTransportListenAddr obfs4 0.0.0.0:CHANGEME
```

Replace "CHANGEME" with a port of your choice.

This port must be externally reachable and must be different from the one specified for **ORPort**. Please avoid port 9001 because it's commonly associated with Tor and censors may be scanning the Internet for this port.

  * One pretty important test you should consider doing is to test if we can talk **obfs4** to the port used by **ServerTransportListenAddr**. Please try our [reachability test tool for obfs4 Bridges](https://bridges.torproject.org/scan/) to check that.

### 5. Enable and Start `tor`

```
# systemctl enable --now tor
```

    ... or restart it if it was running already, so configurations take effect

```
# systemctl restart tor
```

  * If **systemd** or `tor` complain about starting `obfs4proxy` by binding its socket to ports lower than 1024, you shall consider changing its binary's cappabilities or overriding Tor's unit. For detailed information please refer to our documentation on [GitLab Ticket #18356](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/18356).

### 6. Final Notes

If you are having trouble setting up your bridge, have a look at [our help section](../../../getting-help/).
If your bridge is now running, check out the [post-install notes](../post-install/).
