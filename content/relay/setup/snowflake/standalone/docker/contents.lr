This guide will help you set up a standalone [Snowflake](https://snowflake.torproject.org) proxy using Docker to help censored users connect to the Tor network.
We have a [Docker image](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/container_registry/11) to ease the setup of a Snowflake proxy.

### 1. Install Docker

The instructions in this step are for Debian-based systems, but you can find [Docker instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for other supported platforms.

Open a terminal and run these commands:
```
$ sudo apt install curl
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
$ sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

### 2. Download the docker compose file

Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/raw/main/docker-compose.yml?ref_type=heads) configuration file.
Run the command to download it:
```
$ wget -O docker-compose.yml https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/raw/main/docker-compose.yml?ref_type=heads
```
Then, deploy the proxy by running:
```
docker compose up -d snowflake-proxy
```
This command starts the Snowflake proxy in detached mode.
You should now see the output:
```
Creating snowflake-proxy ... done
```
and your proxy is up and running!

### 3. Checking your Docker logs

```
$ docker logs -f snowflake-proxy
```

### 4. Automatic updates with Watchtower

The [docker-compose.yml](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/raw/main/docker-compose.yml?ref_type=heads) file contains a `watchtower` container, configured to automatically check for updates to the snowflake docker container every day, download them and run them.
If you would like to use it, run the following command:
```
$ docker compose up -d
```
Now your snowflake proxy will stay updated automatically!

Otherwise, you will need to periodically pull the latest container and restart it manually.
