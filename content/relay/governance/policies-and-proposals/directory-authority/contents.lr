# Directory Authorities
Directory Authorities are important components within the Tor network that serve as trusted entities responsible for managing and maintaining the list of Tor relays.

They are a set of specialized servers within the Tor network that collectively generate and distribute a signed document (known as the consensus) containing information about all known Tor relays.
These authorities are operated by trusted organizations or individuals with a strong commitment to the principles of privacy, security, and network neutrality.
